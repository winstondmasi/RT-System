Race timing system

A race timing system, that tracks every lap time set by a
driver, this should include their name, the tyre they used (Hard,Medium, Soft, Intermediate, Wet) and their lap time.
Then, create a leaderboard system, that searches for the best
time set by every driver and orders them from fastest to slowest.This should be updated automatically, every time a new time is set.

1. A window with 3 fields and a button. The fields will be for the name, tyre and lap time. The button will be to submit the information entered in the fields. When the submit button is pressed, the information in the fields should be printed to the console.

2. A table with the same headings as the fields in the first task. the your submit button will add the entries in the field to the table you just created.

3. A second view for the window. should be able to change between the two views with two buttons in the window. On the leaderboard view, there should only be a table. This table will be automatically updated each time a new time is submitted. It will contain the name and best lap time of every name that has submitted a lap.
